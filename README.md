Eclipse setup for developers
============================

You need a classpath variable in Eclipse named M2_REPO to point
at the repository folder inside your .m2 repository. 
Some Eclipse distributions have this by default, some don't


GIT checkout of repository
==========================

git clone https://gitusername@github.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/Yggdrasil.git

Replace 'gitusername' with your own gitusername.
This is necessary, if you want to push commits back to master branch
